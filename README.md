I'm currently learning React. After doing some projects in vanilla JavaScript I felt conformant to start learning the most popular JavaScript framework and I really liked it!

In this small project, I could see the facilities of "useState" and I have to say it: It made my life easier.

I'm planning in future add more features but for now, I think It's better to do more complex projects
